Zooming in on Zoomers:
A Comprehensive Analysis of Quebec’s Shifting Secession Dynamics
Introduction
In the digital and technological age, what are the attitudes of younger generations toward issues that have shaped and continue to shape the international political landscape, particularly nationalism and territorial integrity? Since the post-industrial era, these issues have posed significant political challenges, especially in multinational states where separatist movements emerge. As Generation Z [1] reaches political majority, it becomes crucial to explore their attitudes toward these issues in a global and digitalized context. Given their unique exposure to social media, global interconnectedness, and shifting political norms (Jayatissa 2023), understanding how this generation approaches nationalism and separatist movements is essential for assessing future political trends.
With regard to broader studies on nationalism and separatist movements in post-industrial multinational states, numerous researchers have examined the cases of Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, and Canada (see for example: Crameri 2015; Broun 2013; Murphy 1989; Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019; Brie and Ouellet 2020; Dubois and Villeneuve-Siconnelly 2019). Recent studies, such as those conducted in Scotland and Catalonia, highlight the growing importance of understanding how young generations, particularly Generation Z, interact with issues of nationalism and identity. For instance, research in Scotland explores how young people’s experiences of geopolitical discourse and daily encounters with diversity shape their sense of ontological security (Botterill et al. 2016). In Catalonia, the complexity of linguistic and identity ideologies among young Catalans reflects their struggle between preserving their cultural identity and adapting to globalization (Byrne 2020). Similarly, studies in Canada reveal the nuanced ways in which young Canadians perceive national identity, influenced by factors such as age, language, and regional history (Brie and Mathieu 2021). These insights into the youth perspective are crucial for understanding the transformation of political landscapes in regions like Quebec, where the separatist question continues to evolve.
Canada, particularly with the case of Quebec, offers a uniquely rich context for understanding the emergence and decline of separatist movements. The Quebec case provides a fertile historical backdrop for rigorous academic analysis and discussion (Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019). Researchers note a transformation in Quebec’s political landscape, leading to analyses of shifts in political positioning within the province (Savoie, Clifton, and Breton 2020; Rocher 2023; Montigny 2023, 2022; Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017; Daoust and Jabbour 2020; Daoust and Gareau-Paquette 2023). While the Quebec secession question has historically been a major factor in understanding Quebec’s electoral behavior, recent trends indicate that it is losing its salience in public opinion. This shift has prompted some to suggest a realignment in the positions of the Quebec electorate (Dubois et al. 2022; Montigny and Margineanu-Plante 2022; Savoie, Clifton, and Breton 2020).
Despite these general trends, little attention has been paid to how Generation Z specifically perceives the issue of Quebec secession compared to older generations. Given the unique sociopolitical context in which Generation Z has matured—marked by globalization, digital communication, and evolving identity politics—it is essential to examine whether their attitudes align with or diverge from those of previous generations (Jayatissa 2023). This study aims to address this gap by explicitly investigating the attitudes of Generation Z toward Quebec’s secession movement in comparison to other generations.
Therefore, the primary research question guiding this study is: Are the factors influencing Generation Z’s attitudes toward Quebec secession the same as those influencing older generations, or have they changed? By exploring this question, the study aims not only to confirm whether previously observed patterns (e.g., cyclical support, strong generational differences, contextual shifts) still hold but also to expand the current understanding by incorporating new data on Generation Z. More specifically, this study investigates how evolving linguistic dynamics and  varying levels of attitude extremity—ranging from moderate to strongly held  positions—influence support for secession across cohorts. This approach provides empirical evidence on the determinants of separatist preferences among different age groups, shedding new light on how younger generations, particularly Generation Z, position themselves relative to their predecessors on the federalist–separatist spectrum.
Therefore, this study builds upon the work of Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout (2017) and Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny (2019), who highlighted the importance of integrating cohort, period, and historical-context effects to better understand the relationship between support for secession and generational dynamics. Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout (2017) emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach (age, period, and cohort effects) to capture the fluctuations in public opinion on long-term political and identity issues, while Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny (2019) stresses the cyclical and multi-generational nature of support for secession, showing that the impact of aging on political opinions is neither linear nor uniform over time.
This article seeks to extend these findings in two ways. First, it analyzes the evolution of separatist support across different cohorts by explicitly incorporating Generation Z, to determine whether its attitudes toward secession align with or diverge from those of older cohorts. Second, it emphasizes the role of language and the strength of convictions (polarized or moderate) to better capture the diversity of positions on Quebec secession. In this way, the study offers a more nuanced perspective on the contemporary mechanisms shaping support for or opposition to secession, considering age, historical context, linguistic identity, and the extremity of political attitudes.
A brief terminological clarification is warranted. Following comparative work on territorial movements (Bishop et al., 2022; Dalle Mulle & Serrano, 2019), this article treats secession as the process of territorial withdrawal, independence as the desired end-state of sovereign statehood, and sovereignty as the constitutional status of ultimate authority. Secession serves as the primary analytical term. Sovereignty is retained when citing scholarship or survey questions employing this terminology, or when discussing the locus of formal political authority. This framework maintains precision while respecting established usage in the Quebec literature.
Responses to the Question in the Current State of Knowledge
The literature on attitudes toward Quebec secession offers valuable insights into the shifting political dynamics of the province, particularly in the context of generational change. This review synthesizes existing research on the determinants of pro-secession attitudes, emphasizing traditional explanatory models centered on rational voter behavior and party affiliation. It then explores the influence of socio-demographic factors, with a focus on age, life-cycle effects, and generational influences, followed by an examination of how key historical events have shaped political socialization and attitudes toward secession. The gaps in current research, particularly regarding Generation Z and the role of linguistic factors, are highlighted to frame the analysis of contemporary predictors of support for Quebec secession.
The question of the factors explaining fluctuations in attitudes towards secession has been raised by many scholars. Some have conducted analyses using voters’ rational thinking or attitudes towards political parties as explanatory factors (Blais and Nadeau 1992; Blais, Martin, and Nadeau 1995; Clarke, Kornberg, and Stewart 2004; Johnstone 1996; LeDuc and Pammett 1995; Mendelsohn 2003). More recently, attention has focused on socio-demographic factors that explain pro-secession attitudes, with age emerging as a significant factor (Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019; Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017). The age variable is analyzed from various perspectives, including life-cycle effects, generational effects, and the impact of specific political events.
Regarding life-cycle effects, it is observed that younger individuals are more likely to favor secession compared to older individuals (Pinard 1994). The theoretical explanation suggests a stronger attachment to the past and the existing system among older individuals compared to younger ones (Gagné and Langlois 2002; Kornberg and Archer 1982). The older population may perceive more to lose than gain from a stable lifestyle in an independent Quebec. Other researchers have noted that this trend diminishes over time, indicating that young people in 1995 were more likely to be pro-secession than those in 2001, despite being young in both years being associated with a greater likelihood of pro-separatist views (Gagné and Langlois 2002). This observation suggests a generational or cohort effect on pro-secession attitudes.
The enduring impact of values acquired during young adulthood on generational cohorts is a central theme in understanding political attitudes, as emphasized by the concept of cohort effects (Inglehart 1971, 1977). This persistence is rooted in the political socialization process during the pre-adult period, which plays a crucial role in shaping and solidifying individuals’ political views (Dinas 2013). Generational succession thus emerges as a key factor in shifts in political stances, with each generation carrying the imprint of the sociopolitical context of its formative years.
In the Quebec context, the baby boomers’ political socialization in the post-war era may contribute to their particular perspectives on the potential costs of Quebec secession (Martin 1994). Generations reaching pre-adulthood before the rise of the separatist movement in the 1960s hold less favorable views on the national question, suggesting that the timing of political maturation influences attitudes toward secession (Pinard, Bernier, and Lemieux 1997).
While generational effects account for the long-term persistence of certain values, specific historical events also significantly influence political attitudes in the short term (Inglehart et al. 2008). Such events can impact all generations to varying degrees when they occur, shaping the collective political landscape. In the context of Quebec, several key events have been identified as significant turning points affecting separatist sentiments.
One pivotal event is the failure of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990 (Yale and Durand 2011; Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017). The Meech Lake Accord was a set of constitutional amendments designed to persuade Quebec to endorse the 1982 Canadian Constitution by recognizing Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada and by granting provinces greater powers. Its failure, due to the refusal of two provinces to ratify the agreement, was perceived in Quebec as a rejection of its unique identity, thereby fueling pro-secession sentiments.
Similarly, the Charlottetown Accord in 1992, another attempt at constitutional reform that included recognition of Quebec’s distinct status, was rejected in a national referendum. This further reinforced feelings of alienation within Quebec (Yale and Durand 2011; Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017).
The 1995 Quebec referendum stands out as a critical event influencing attitudes toward secession (Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017; Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019). In this referendum, Quebecers were asked whether Quebec should become sovereign after making a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership. The result was a narrow defeat for the separatist option, with 49.4 per cent voting "Yes" and 50.6 per cent voting "No", leaving the province deeply divided.
The sponsorship scandal, revealed in the early 2000s and culminating with the Gomery Commission report in 2005, involved the misuse and misdirection of federal funds intended to promote federalism in Quebec after the 1995 referendum. The scandal exposed corruption within the federal government and was perceived by many Quebecers as a betrayal, temporarily boosting pro-secession attitudes (Yale and Durand 2011; Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017).
Earlier historical events also contributed significantly to the pro-secession movement. The Quiet Revolution of the 1960s was a period of rapid social, political, and cultural change in Quebec, characterized by secularization, modernization of the economy, and the emergence of a strong Quebec nationalism. General Charles de Gaulle’s speech in Montreal in 1967, where he proclaimed "Vive le Québec libre!" ("Long live free Quebec!"), was a significant moment that internationalized the Quebec secession movement (Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019). The October Crisis of 1970, involving the kidnapping of government officials by the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) and the subsequent invocation of the War Measures Act by the federal government, had profound effects on Quebec society and politics (Tetley 2006).
The rise to power of the Parti Québécois (PQ), a sovereigntist political party, in 1976 marked another significant milestone. The PQ’s election victory led to the first referendum on Quebec secession in 1980, where 40.4 per cent voted in favor of secession. These events during the 1960s and 1970s are associated with increased pro-secession attitudes (Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019).
These historical moments had varying impacts on attitudes toward secession. The failure of constitutional reforms like the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords in the 1990s intensified feelings of marginalization within Quebec, contributing to the rise in separatist sentiments (Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017). After the 1995 referendum, there was a gradual decline in support for secession until the sponsorship scandal temporarily boosted pro-secession attitudes in the early 2000s (Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017). However, this resurgence was short-lived, and pro-secession sentiments have fluctuated since then.
Understanding attitudes toward secession requires considering the interplay of age, generational influences, and historical periods. Support for secession is not exclusive to a single generation; it exhibits a cyclical pattern that varies over time and across different cohorts, indicating that life-cycle effects are dynamic (Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019). While Baby Boomers may show a higher inclination toward secession, it is essential to view generational effects within a broader context that includes life cycles and significant events (Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017; Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019). Adopting a comprehensive approach prevents the exaggeration of any single factor and provides a more nuanced understanding of how opinions are shaped.
Generation Z and Attitudes Toward Quebec secession
Recent research has begun to focus on Generation Z—those born after 1995—and their attitudes toward Quebec secession. This cohort has grown up in a post-referendum era, lacking direct experience with the constitutional debates that shaped previous generations. Understanding their perspectives is crucial for assessing the future trajectory of the separatist movement.
Studies indicate that Generation Z exhibits distinct patterns in identity formation, political priorities, and engagement with Quebec's constitutional future. Rivest (2019) observes that young Quebecers reject dichotomous identity categorizations, such as exclusively "Québécois" or "Canadian." Instead, they favor fluid and pluralistic identities, reflecting a broader trend toward personalization and pluralism in contemporary society. This contrasts with earlier generations, where identity was more closely tied to the national question.
Challenging the notion that Generation Z identifies primarily as "citizens of the world," Dallaire (2019) reveals that a majority of young Quebecers still consider themselves Quebecois first (66 per cent among francophones), with only a small fraction identifying as global citizens (7 per cent). However, the intensity of their attachment to Quebec is less pronounced compared to older generations. Among francophone youths aged 18–24, only 43 per cent feel "strongly attached" to Quebec, compared to over 67 per cent among those aged 55–64 (Dallaire 2019). This suggests a generational shift in the depth of regional attachment. Similar findings are reported by Mahéo and Bélanger (2018), who note that only 44 per cent of the 18–34 age group feel very attached to Quebec, in contrast to 70 per cent of baby boomers. They highlight that this lower level of attachment among younger Quebecers is surprising and indicates that they may be disconnected from the traditional nationalist sentiments in the province.
Political priorities among Generation Z also differ significantly from those of older cohorts. The question of Quebec's independence ranks low among their concerns. Dallaire (2019) finds that only 4 per cent of young voters list sovereignty among their top two electoral issues. Instead, they prioritize education (40 per cent), health care (32 per cent), and the environment (26 per cent). This aligns with the findings of Mahéo and Bélanger (2018), who note that young Quebecers demonstrate lower levels of interest in the independence question and are less attached to Quebec compared to older generations.
The political socialization of Generation Z has been influenced by events distinct from those that shaped previous generations. Rivest (2019) highlights the impact of the 2012 "Maple Spring" student protests, the election of Justin Trudeau, and global political shifts, such as the transition from the Obama to the Trump administration. Dallaire (2019) notes that for 44 per cent of young Quebecers, the 2012 student crisis and climate change were the primary catalysts for their political interest, whereas only 7 per cent cited Quebec’s constitutional future.
Generational differences in support for separatism are evident in recent studies. Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny (2019) identify a cyclical generational effect, with support for secession peaking and declining across different age groups. They find that those born after 1995 are less in favor of secession, with younger electors showing polarization on the issue—older millennials being more supportive than the youngest voters. Similarly, Mahéo and Bélanger (2024) observe that young Quebecers are less supportive of Quebec secession and exhibit lower levels of nationalist sentiment compared to baby boomers.
Brie and Mathieu (2021) suggest that the high proportion of undecided youths on the national question does not necessarily signal the end of the secession option. They argue that young francophones, while less likely to identify as independentists, represent a potential reservoir of support for separatism, especially if re-engaged through active debate or presented with a renewed vision aligning with their values.
Understanding the attitudes of Generation Z toward secession requires considering the interplay of generational influences and contemporary sociopolitical contexts. Their fluid identity perceptions, different political priorities, and unique socialization experiences might contribute to a lower emphasis on secession as a political issue. These findings highlight the importance of considering generational shifts when analyzing support for secession and suggest that the movement may need to adapt to resonate with the values and concerns of younger cohorts.
Language, Nationalism, and Separatism
Building upon the insights into Generation Z’s evolving perspectives, it is essential to (re)examine how language continues to influence nationalism and separatist sentiments in Quebec. Language is a central component of nationalism (Smith 1998) and has historically served as a cornerstone of nationalist movements among minority nations such as Catalonia (Pomerleau 2020; Stewart, Pinter, and Eisenstein 2018), the Basque Country (Montaña 1996), Brittany (Timm 2009), and Flanders (Blommaert 1996).
Marquardt (2022), in his analysis of linguistic minorities in Moldova, argues that speakers of peripheral languages are more inclined to support separatism as a means to protect their language’s status and, by extension, their social mobility. Conversely, speakers of the central state language often oppose separatist movements, benefiting from the privileged status their language enjoys. This dynamic is mirrored in Quebec, where the interplay between French and English significantly shapes nationalist and separatist discourses.
Historically, the relationship between peripheral and central languages in Quebec has been pivotal. According to McRoberts (1984), the neo-nationalism driving the separatist movement, spearheaded by the PQ, was fueled by French-speaking Quebecers’ desire to establish a welfare state that would enhance social mobility, previously constrained by the economic dominance of Anglophones. The prospect of an independent nation-state was viewed as a pathway to securing this social mobility (McRoberts 1984). In contrast, Anglophones perceived the francophone-dominated subnational state as a threat to their privileged status, leading many to leave Quebec in anticipation of a potential referendum victory for independence (Stevenson 1999).
Despite a gradual shift toward civic nationalism among Quebecers (Cossette-Lefebvre and Daoust 2020), the intertwining of nationalism and the predominance of the French language remains imbued with ethnic undertones (Oakes 2004). This ethno-linguistic dimension is particularly pronounced in the context of secession, where an apparent divide exists between francophone and anglophone voters. For instance, in the 1995 referendum, a substantial majority of francophones (61 per cent) voted "yes" for secession, whereas only 9 per cent of allophones and Anglophones supported the movement (Clarke and Kornberg 1996).
In the contemporary landscape, even though the question of Quebec independence has diminished in prominence, linguistic lines continue to influence political allegiances. Francophones are more likely to support separatist parties such as the Parti Québécois or Québec solidaire, while Anglophones and allophones predominantly back the federalist Quebec Liberal Party (Bélanger et al. 2022). This alignment is corroborated by Dassonneville, Fréchet, and Liang (2022), who found that Anglophones are generally opposed to secession, whereas francophones display a range of attitudes from support to ambivalence. Notably, emerging research indicates shifts in the attitudes of young allophones toward secession. Those who have been socialized in French exhibit a stronger sense of belonging to Quebec and are less vehemently opposed to secession (Bélanger and Perrella 2008; Bilodeau 2016).
These observations suggest that while the Quebec separatist movement aspires to embody civic nationalism, its foundations are deeply rooted in an ethno-linguistic divide. The interplay between language and nationalism remains a critical factor, especially as younger generations navigate their identities in a changing sociopolitical landscape.
Therefore, the present study aims to discern whether the forces traditionally associated with separatist support—age, generational socialization, pivotal historical events, and linguistic affiliation—continue to resonate with Generation Z or have given way to new dynamics. The literature suggests that this emerging cohort, shaped by globalization, digital communication, and fluid identity constructions, may hold attitudes less anchored in the historical legacies that profoundly influenced older generations. Addressing this question is essential for clarifying whether contemporary trends in support for Quebec secession reflect a mere cyclical pattern or signal a more profound realignment of political beliefs. The following section turns to the analytical framework and data sources employed  in this study, designed to elucidate the continuity or transformation of separatist  preferences across successive generations.
Data
This article presents an analysis of the evolution of attitudes towards Quebec’s secession across different generations and regions. The research relies on a comprehensive dataset obtained from multiple surveys, with a focus on data from Quebec residents [2]. The data cleaning process ensured uniformity in integrating different surveys. The study includes data from the Canadian Electoral Studies (1974 to 2021) [3] and Synopsis political surveys (2022 to 2023). The Canadian Electoral Studies data encompasses variables like positions on Quebec secession, age, region, gender, language, family income, and place of birth within Canada. The years 1974, 1979, 1984, 1988, 1993, 2004, 2008, 2015, 2019, and 2021 were selected based on the availability of relevant variables, and the variations in questions on Quebec's constitutional status over these years are detailed in appendix B.
All surveys conducted between January and September 2022 (and subsequently in August 2023) included standard socio-demographic variables and political attitudes, including Quebec secession. They were carried out in partnership with the Canadian firm Synopsis using the Léger firm’s panel (LEO), ensuring methodological consistency across each wave.
These surveys were comprehensive, including various socio-demographic variables and political attitudes. Ethical considerations were observed, with data confidentiality maintained through non-disclosure agreements. The surveys’ design and execution were carefully structured to ensure the collection of relevant and reliable data to analyze Quebec’s evolving secession attitudes.
The surveys underwent pre-stratification based on Quebec’s population demographics, considering variables including age, gender, housing type, language, income, and education level. The cleaning process was designed to enhance compatibility for integration with other surveys and the Canadian Electoral Studies, ensuring consistency across datasets. In pursuit of this goal, the datasets were cleansed to enable seamless merging with other surveys and the Canadian Electoral Studies. Ultimately, the dataset comprised n = 12,191 complete cases after the removal of missing data in the dependent or independent variables.
Methodology
Two different dependent variables are used in this analysis. The first captures respondents' position on Quebec secession. For analyses using this variable, linear regression models were estimated. Given that response scales varied across survey years—including dichotomous questions, 4-point Likert scales, and 5-point Likert scales with a neutral option—all responses were standardized onto a common 0-to-1 continuum, where 0 represents a federalist stance and 1 a separatist one.[a]
The transformation proceeded as follows: For dichotomous questions, responses were coded as 0 (federalist) and 1 (separatist). For 4-point scales, values were linearly rescaled as 1→0, 2→0.33, 3→0.67, and 4→1. For 5-point scales with a neutral midpoint, values were rescaled as 1→0, 2→0.25, 3→0.5, 4→0.75, and 5→1. This proportional transformation preserves ordinal ranking while creating a common metric.
This standardization facilitates longitudinal comparison but introduces three key limitations. First, it treats ordinal response categories as if they were interval-level measurements with equal spacing between options (Liddell & Kruschke, 2018). Second, measurement non-equivalence across survey waves may bias trend estimates, as dichotomous referendum questions likely evoke more polarized responses than multi-point hypothetical scales (Davidov et al., 2014). Third, the presence versus absence of a neutral midpoint creates asymmetries: respondents on 5-point scales could express genuine ambivalence (coded 0.5), whereas those on 4-point forced-choice scales were compelled to lean toward a position, potentially inflating apparent polarization in those years (Weijters et al., 2010). Despite these limitations, standardization remains necessary for analyzing trends across nearly five decades of survey instruments.
The second dependent variable captures attitude extremity, operationalized as holding an extreme position on the secession question. Following established practices in attitude research (Abelson, 1995; Krosnick & Petty, 1995), responses were coded as 1 when respondents expressed an extreme position (either strongly in favor or strongly opposed to secession), and 0 for more moderate responses. On 4-point scales, values of 1 and 4 were coded as extreme; on 5-point scales, values of 1 and 5; dichotomous responses were excluded from extremity analyses as they preclude differentiation between moderate and extreme positions. For this variable, binomial logistic regression models were used.
Attitude extremity represents a distinct dimension of attitude strength, specifically measuring the degree to which attitudes deviate from the neutral midpoint (Abelson, 1995; Krosnick & Petty, 1995). This dimension differs from other strength-related attributes such as attitude certainty, importance, or emotional intensity (Haddock et al., 1999). The focus on extremity is theoretically justified in the context of territorial politics, where crystallizing events like referendums tend to push attitudes toward the poles of the continuum (Hobolt & Tilley, 2025), making extremity particularly relevant for understanding generational differences in secession attitudes.
To interpret the results, predicted probabilities derived from the models were used, holding all variables constant except for generation (and language, in some cases). This approach allowed isolation of the specific effect of these variables while controlling for other factors.
Participants were classified into distinct generational cohorts (Pre-Boomers, Boomers, Generations X, Y, and Z) based on their birth year. This categorization was aligned with the age groups defined in the 2021 Canadian Census data to facilitate the analysis of prevailing attitudes. The birth year ranges for each generation were as follows: Pre-Boomers (1925-1946), Boomers (1947-1961), X (1962-1976), Y (1977-1991) and Z (1992-2003). A potential limitation of this study is that the generational boundaries are somewhat arbitrary because their definition is influenced by the alignment with census data. Another limitation resides in the fact that, while these generational groups are not entirely homogeneous, our analysis treats them as clean-cut groups (Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny 2019).
Results
Past evolution and effects of constitutional events
Figure 1 illustrates the predicted position[b] on the federalist–separatist continuum for each generation over time, based on a standardized respondent profile. The vertical axis ranges from “more federalist” (bottom) to “more separatist” (top), and each line traces the average predicted attitude for a generation across different survey years. Vertical dashed lines indicate major constitutional events related to Quebec’s national question. To help contextualize these results, the age range of each generation at a given time point is displayed just above the corresponding year on the horizontal axis.
These predictions are derived from a series of yearly regression models (n = 11) estimating support for secession, with generation as the key variable of interest. All other variables are held constant to isolate generational patterns[c].
[Figure 1]
Overall, a clear association emerges between major secession-related events and surges in separatist support, particularly for the Pre-Boomer, Boomer, Generation X, and Generation Y cohorts. Notably, each of these cohorts reaches a comparatively higher position on the separatist dimension during or shortly after a pivotal event (e.g., the 1980 referendum), with peaks often observed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Following the failed 1995 referendum, a marked decline in separatist support is visible across cohorts, although the trajectories diverge: while the Pre-Boomer and Boomer cohorts show a modest reduction and eventual stabilization, Generation X experiences a more abrupt drop. A second upward shift is apparent in the early 2000s, coinciding with the Sponsorship Scandal, which seems to rekindle support for separatism across multiple age groups.
Subsequently, from roughly 2010 onward, separatist sentiment diminishes for most cohorts. The Pre-Boomer and Boomer cohorts exhibit a relatively stable or gradually declining stance, whereas Generations X and Y show a more pronounced downturn. For the youngest cohort, Generation Z, positions hover near neutrality, displaying variability but without a sustained move toward either extreme. Notably, this later period includes fewer major constitutional flashpoints, which may partly explain the general waning of separatist support.
Finally, the uncertainty is greater for the earliest points of each cohort because the first years only include respondents aged 18 and older, even though the cohort itself encompasses younger individuals. As a result, there are fewer respondents represented in those early data points. This pattern is particularly evident when observing the first point for Generation X. Taken together, these results underscore the potent influence of historically salient events on generational opinion, as well as the gradual tapering of separatist sentiment in the absence of a galvanizing political context.[d]




To assess whether these temporal associations reflect causal effects of constitutional events, Figure 2 presents results from a difference-in-differences event study design. This quasi-experimental approach compares changes in sovereignty support before and after major constitutional moments (1980 referendum, Meech Lake 1990, 1995 referendum, Sponsorship scandal 2005) against placebo periods without such events (2012, 2020). While the placebo periods are imperfect (2012 coincided with the PQ's provincial election victory), they represent the most suitable comparison points available in our data.
Among treatment events, the 1980 referendum shows the strongest post-event effects. Pre-boomers and Boomers exhibited increases of 0.17 and 0.14 points respectively on the 0-to-1 sovereignty scale (p < 0.001). Meech Lake's failure in 1990 also produced significant effects, though more modest and limited to older generations (Pre-boomers: +0.08, p < 0.01; Boomers: +0.07, p < 0.05), with no detectable effect among Generation X. For both events, the parallel trends assumption is satisfied (see Table 6 in Appendix D).
In contrast, neither the 1995 referendum nor the Sponsorship scandal produced significant post-event effects across any generation. Moreover, the parallel trends assumption is violated for both events, further weakening any causal interpretation. These findings suggest that not all constitutional moments have equal mobilizing power.
The placebo periods, however, do not show the null effects expected under a clean quasi-experimental design. Instead, generational trajectories diverge: post-Boomer generations (X, Y, and Z) shift toward federalism, while Boomers shift slightly toward sovereignty. These significant placebo effects limit the causal interpretation of treatment events, as they indicate that factors beyond constitutional moments contribute to generational divergence in sovereignty attitudes.
[NOUVELLE figure 2]
A complementary HAPC-CCREM analysis formally disentangles age, period, and cohort effects (see Appendix D for full results). Period effects account for approximately 2.5 times more variance than cohort effects, though both are statistically significant. Cohort effects confirm the generational divide observed in Figure 1: Boomers are the most sovereigntist generation while Generation Z is the most federalist. However, the model leaves 86 percent of variance unexplained, indicating that individual-level factors such as language (examined in subsequent analyses) play a substantial role. These findings are consistent with Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout (2017), who similarly found period effects to dominate cohort effects.
Current attitudes
Figure 2[e] displays the predicted probability of supporting Quebec secession based on data from 2021 to 2023, modeled with an interaction between generation and language (n = 10,609). Predictions are computed for a standardized respondent profile, holding all other variables constant. The outcome is based on a linear regression applied to a 0-to-1 scale, where 0 indicates a federalist stance and 1 a separatist one. These are model-based predictions for a constant profile, not population averages.
Among Francophones, the predicted support for secession declines steadily across generations, with values of 0.59 for Boomers, 0.49 for Generation X, 0.44 for Generation Y, and 0.40 for Generation Z. In contrast, among Anglophones, predicted support increases across cohorts: Boomers score 0.13, followed by Generation X (0.17), Generation Y (0.25), and Generation Z (0.26). For Allophone respondents, no clear generational trend emerges, as predicted values remain relatively stable over time.
Notably, Generation Z converges around a moderately federalist position across all language groups, suggesting a lower degree of variation in pro-secession attitudes among the youngest cohort.
[Figure 2][f]
Figure 3[g] presents the predicted probability of holding a strong position on the secession scale, meaning respondents are at either extreme (highly federalist or highly separatist), rather than near the midpoint. Thus, higher values (e.g., 100 per cent) reflect a greater likelihood of having a strongly held opinion—regardless of whether it favors separation or federalism.
[Figure 3][h]
Across all generations, Francophones exhibit less extreme attitudes than Anglophones or Allophones. Their predicted probabilities remain relatively stable: Pre-Boomers at 62 per cent, Boomers at 55 per cent, Generation X at 56 per cent, Generation Y at 52 per cent, and Generation Z at 53 per cent. By contrast, Anglophones show a notable decline in extreme attitudes across successive generations: Pre-Boomers and Boomers at 88 per cent, Generation X at 83 per cent, Generation Y at 72 per cent, and Generation Z at 67 per cent. Among Allophones, no clear intergenerational differences emerge, likely due to large margins of error in the estimates.
Figure 4[i] illustrates the proportion of respondents from each generation who identify as Québécois before Canadian, based on 2022 data () with 95 per cent confidence intervals.
[Figure 4][j]
The Pre-Boomer, Generation X, and Generation Y cohorts reported primary Québécois identities at rates of 56 per cent, 57 per cent, and 58 per cent, respectively. In comparison, Boomers and Generation Z exhibited higher rates of 67 per cent and 68 per cent . Despite the higher percentages among Boomers and Generation Z, the majority within each generation maintain a Québécois-first identity. Taking margins of error into account, these findings indicate two distinct groups: Pre-Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y with more moderate Québécois-first identification, and Boomers and Generation Z with consistently higher proportions. Regardless of their differing historical contexts, Boomers and Generation Z share a stronger Québécois identity.
As in Figure 3[k], higher probabilities in Figure 5[l] reflect stronger positions at either extreme on the secession scale, not strictly separatist views. In 2022, individuals who identify primarily as Canadian display higher attitudinal intensity across all cohorts, whereas those who identify primarily as Québécois show consistently lower levels of intensity.
[Figure 5][m]
Overall, significant events related to the separatist movement are associated with increases in support for secession, followed by declines—either slight or pronounced depending on the generation—during periods without major events. Generation Z has not experienced notable events compared to other generations and thus exhibits support levels oscillating around neutrality between 2019 and 2022. When examining the likelihood of supporting secession, Francophones exhibit a declining trend across successive generations, whereas Anglophones show the opposite pattern, and Allophones remain comparatively stable. The propensity to hold stronger views on the secession scale tends to be lower among Francophones than among Anglophones or Allophones, and it diminishes progressively across younger Anglophone cohorts. Additionally, data on self-identification reveal that Boomers and Generation Z share higher levels of Québécois-first identity, distinguishing them from other cohorts with more moderate tendencies. Finally, individuals identifying primarily as Canadian generally show higher attitudinal intensity than those identifying primarily as Québécois, regardless of generation.
Discussion
Theories of political socialization suggest that the values individuals acquire during early adulthood are central to shaping their subsequent political attitudes (Inglehart 1971, 1977). In line with these theories and consistent with the findings of Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny (2019) and Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout (2017), as well as the theoretical assumptions of Pinard, Bernier, and Lemieux (1997), our findings indicate that Baby Boomers’ support for Quebec secession evolved in response to several key events related to the separatist movement. Specifically, Baby Boomers experienced at least three major moments tied to constitutional negotiations and referendums during their formative years, which corresponded to a notable rise in their endorsement of secession. In the aftermath of these events, once their early adulthood period ended, Baby Boomers’ attitudes stabilized slightly above neutrality, although they did exhibit a modest decline in support for secession during the post-referendum era.
These observations lend credence to the argument that values acquired during one’s early adulthood exert a persistent influence on the development and consolidation of political orientations (Dinas 2013). Our results also align with the conclusions of Dufresne, Tessier, and Montigny (2019) and (Vallée-Dubois, Dassonneville, and Godbout 2017), who posit that support for Quebec secession is neither exclusively the preserve of a single generation nor solely dependent on age (i.e., “young” versus “old”). Instead, understanding shifts in pro-secession sentiment requires careful attention to historically significant contexts. Indeed, crucial turning points in the debate on Quebec’s future within Canada appear to be associated with fluctuations in secession support, regardless of generational membership.
In this regard, Generation Z, just now entering its early adulthood, has not yet encountered any major events directly tied to the question of Quebec’s secession. Consequently, its current attitudes toward secession remain relatively neutral or are in line with the existing status quo, leaning slightly toward federalism. The presence (or absence) of decisive moments related to the separatist issue, however, could act as either catalysts or attenuators of this generation’s support for secession in the coming years.
Our data from 2021 to 2023 indicate that support for secession among Francophones decreases across successive generations, with Generation Z Francophones exhibiting less inclination toward secession than their older counterparts. In contrast, the data reveal an inverse trend among Anglophones: Generation Z  Anglophones demonstrate a weaker commitment to federalism compared to older  Anglophone cohorts. Additionally, our data do not allow us to differentiate between Allophones who were socialized in French and those who were not, which would have been necessary to evaluate the observations made by Bélanger and Perrella (2008; Bilodeau 2016).
These patterns suggest a general trend of depolarization between linguistic groups among younger generations. Drawing on theories of issue-based affective polarization (Hobolt and Tilley 2025), this depolarization can be understood as stemming from reduced issue salience and the absence of crystallizing political events. Territorial issues like Quebec secession generate strong in-group identities precisely because they are rooted in pre-existing social categories such as language (Hobolt and Tilley 2025, 233). However, the crystallization of these language-based divisions into political polarization requires high-salience events, particularly referendums, that create unmistakable in-groups and out-groups through the behavioral act of voting (Lecours 2018; Fieldhouse and Prosser 2018). Baby Boomers and Generation X experienced multiple such crystallizing events during their formative years (the 1980 and 1995 referendums, the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords), allowing these cohorts to develop strong and enduring attitudes toward secession along linguistic lines.
Language has historically played a central role in shaping nationalist and separatist sentiments in Quebec (Clarke and Kornberg 1996; Dassonneville, Fréchet, and Liang 2022). Generations socialized during periods of intense political activity around secession, when the issue was highly contested and behaviorally salient, exhibited higher levels of linguistic polarization and more entrenched positions on the issue. The decreasing polarization between linguistic groups in younger generations does not necessarily imply that language is no longer a significant determinant of attitudes toward secession. Rather, it reflects a theoretically predictable pattern: in the absence of recent, high-salience events that galvanize the secession debate, issue-based identities rooted in language remain less politically activated (Hobolt and Tilley 2025). Generation Z matured during three decades without a referendum or major constitutional crisis, and with the Parti Québécois abandoning first-term referendum promises (Lecours 2018). Without such crystallizing events to heighten the prominence of the secession question and compel self-categorization into distinct camps, linguistic groups adopt more moderate and less polarized positions.
Regarding the extremity of attitudes, our results indicate a generational decline in the intensity of pro-secession sentiments, particularly among Anglophones. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 3[n], both Anglophones and Allophones exhibit more extreme attitudes toward Quebec secession compared to Francophones. This observation is logically consistent with the following argument: Anglophones tend to be more federalist and less divided on the issue of Quebec’s secession than Francophones, who may hold varied positions ranging from separatist to autonomist nationalism—which advocates for Quebec’s autonomy within Canada—to federalist (Dassonneville, Fréchet, and Liang 2022; Montigny and Margineanu-Plante 2022). Consequently, as Francophones present more polarized positions on the issue, it is reasonable to observe that Anglophones, who are generally federalist, exhibit stronger and more homogenous attitudes on the pro-secession attitude scale, reflecting a robust federalist stance.
Similarly, our findings reveal that individuals identifying primarily as Canadian generally show higher attitudinal intensity than those identifying primarily as Québécois, regardless of generation. This observation aligns with the aforementioned argument, as it suggests that individuals who identify first as Canadian have less ambiguity in their attitudes toward Quebec’s secession. In contrast, those who identify primarily as Québécois do not necessarily lean toward separatism, allowing for a broader range of positions. It appears logically consistent that individuals who primarily identify as Canadian and reside in Quebec are less likely to support Quebec’s secession, as their national identity aligns with maintaining the union.
Furthermore, it is theorized that the observed decline in the extremity of attitudes among young Anglophones is related to their lack of socialization during periods when the secession question was prominently debated. Unlike older Anglophone cohorts who experienced significant events central to Quebec’s secession movement, Generation Z Anglophones were not socialized in contexts where secession was a salient issue. As a result, their attitudes toward secession are less pronounced compared to older Anglophones who lived through pivotal events that shaped strong federalist positions. This pattern aligns with theories of issue-based identity formation: behavioral commitment to a position (e.g., voting in high-stakes referendums) strengthens both in-group belonging and out-group differentiation (Hobolt and Tilley 2025, 232). Older Anglophones' strong federalist positions were consolidated through repeated behavioral expressions (voting 'No') during salient constitutional moments. Generation Z Anglophones, lacking such formative experiences, exhibit weaker attitudinal intensity.
Concerning the level of Quebec-first identification, a high proportion of “Quebec-first” identification among Generation Z—comparable to that of the Baby Boomer cohort—does not necessarily inform us about the intensity of Gen Z’s Quebec identity. Rather, it simply indicates that, when faced with a binary choice between identifying primarily with Quebec or with Canada, the majority of Gen Z leans toward Quebec. The fact that the descriptive proportion of Gen Z individuals identifying primarily with Quebec is comparable to that of baby boomers (the generation historically exhibiting the most enduring support for Quebec secession) does not, on its own, allow for robust inferences regarding Gen Z’s position on secession.
Nevertheless, these findings do nuance certain assumptions about a post-national, fluid identity among younger cohorts, such as those put forth by Rivest (2019). They also open the possibility—albeit tentatively—that if Generation Z shows a level of Quebec-first identification similar to baby boomers and indeed higher than other cohorts, then this generation might not remain permanently neutral on the question of Quebec’s secession. This suggests a testable theoretical mechanism: Generation Z's high Quebec-first identification may represent latent separatist potential that remains unactivated due to low issue salience. Issue-based affective polarization theory predicts that identities rooted in territorial demands can be crystallized or attenuated depending on political events (Hobolt and Tilley 2025). Future high-salience events, such as a referendum or constitutional crisis, could transform Gen Z's Quebec identity into mobilized separatist support, particularly if framed around values resonating with this cohort. Conversely, continued absence of such events may sustain depolarization. Measuring attachment strength (as per Mahéo and Bélanger 2018; Dallaire 2019) and tracking Gen Z responses to potential future constitutional debates would test these theoretical implications.
Several limitations should be acknowledged in interpreting these findings. The generational boundaries employed in this study, though aligned with Canadian census data, remain somewhat arbitrary constructs that may not perfectly capture the fluidity of cohort experiences. Our analysis treats generational groups as discrete entities, potentially overlooking intra-generational heterogeneity that could enrich our understanding of attitudes toward secession. The dataset contained relatively few allophone respondents, limiting our ability to draw robust conclusions about this linguistically diverse group. Furthermore, our methodology does not account for the influence of cross-linguistic relationships or bilingualism, which may increasingly moderate attitudes toward secession, particularly among younger generations navigating multilingual social environments. While these limitations constrain the scope of our interpretations, they do not undermine the empirical patterns identified across generations and linguistic groups.
Despite these constraints, this study makes a meaningful contribution to our understanding of Quebec’s evolving political landscape by demonstrating that Generation Z exhibits unique patterns of engagement with the question of Quebec secession compared to previous generations. Our findings reveal a convergence toward less polarized positions across linguistic groups within this cohort, alongside consistently high levels of Québécois-first identification. The absence of formative exposure to constitutional crises appears central to Generation Z’s relatively neutral stance on secession, while suggesting that this neutrality should not be misinterpreted as indifference to Quebec identity. Rather than signaling the inevitable decline of the secessionist movement, these results indicate that separatist sentiment may remain latent, potentially responsive to future catalyzing events that resonate with younger Quebecers’ values and concerns. By illuminating these generational patterns, this research advances scholarly discourse on the complex interplay between age, language, identity, and political attitudes in multinational democratic contexts.
